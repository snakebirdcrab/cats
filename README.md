NOTES ON DURATION OF PROJECT
************************************

It's hard to accurately estimate the number of hours spent building, since I worked on this project sporadically whenever I had decent chunks of time available, but I'd say I spent about 3-4 "work days" (~8h per day, but including breaks/meals, etc. just as a typical work day would).

I spent a large percentage of the time learning react/redux and figuring out how to structure this app using those best practices, and much less time actually writing code.

I spent the least amount of time on the UI and just tried to make it decent. I could definitely spend many more hours on it adding fancy features, but it makes more sense to submit the project at some point.



************************************
SOME NOTES ON PROJECT DECISIONS
************************************

I wanted to use stylus for my css preprocessor, but was having trouble getting the compiler working with babelify. I'm sure it's one of those things that's really not hard at all and just involves a particular configuation, but I decided to not spend any more time on it and just go with plain boring css in the end.

I'm definitely not a designer, so the UI is admittedly nothing special. I just tried to make it clean and to include the desired functionalities. I decided to forgo any of the further suggested fancy UI features in order to allocate more of my time learning the react/redux components of the app, although those things (e.g., sorting by fact length, etc.) are definitely things I'm more than capable of.

Being completely honest, I was definitely in "playing around and learning stuff" mode and half the time forgot I was even using git, so please don't use my commits as any sort of indication as to how I typically work. (Though I would say when I'm learning something totally new, some of this is actually how I typically work.)
